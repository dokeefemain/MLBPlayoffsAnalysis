# MLBPlayoffsAnalysis
This is a project designed to predict whether or not a MLB team will make playoffs based on their pitching and hitting stats. For input it was all MLB pitching and hitting data from 2009 to 2019. The model used is logistic regression since the goal was to predict a binary attribute being yes or no for a team making playoffs. The model ended up getting a 92% accuracy with 95% precision and 79% recall. I tested some single cases being the Nationals in 2019, Braves in 2019, and the Braves in 2017 and it returned the correct value of all of them. The data source used was Baseball-Reference which made it really easy to get all of the data into CSV format. The code for the model can be found in PitchHit.py .
