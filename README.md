# MLBPlayoffsAnalysis
Currently we are only working on getting the data and prepairing it.
We will use AddPlay.py to add the playoffs stats to each csv only thing needed is an array of the teams that qualified each year.
MakeOne.py is just for us to be able to combine seasons together so we can get a larger data set.
test.py is just me manipulating the data using some of the things we have learned so far.
