# MLBPlayoffsAnalysis
Currently we are only working on getting the data and prepairing it.
We will use AddPlay.py to add the playoffs stats to each csv. The only thing needed is an array of the teams that qualified each year.
MakeOne.py is just for us to be able to combine seasons together so we can get a larger data set.
PitchHit.py is Feature selection and classification program for Pitching and Hitting data over the last 10 years. It's able to get 92% accuracy and 95% percision which is really good. I had prevously only been testing it on pitching and was getting 78% accuracy and 88%. By adding batting into the mix it really helped out the scores. I was even able to enter a team, being the Washington Nationals in 2019, and the model correctly predected them making playoffs.
